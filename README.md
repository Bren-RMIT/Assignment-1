Technology Relationship:
I'm new to the world of I.T. but have a passion for learning new things and I.T. seems to me to be all about new things. It is constantly changing the way people all over the world are living and relating to one another, both for good and ill. Due to being very much of the beginner level, I can't really create a website or present any ideas with any authority or knowledge about how simple or hoe realistic they can be built. Saying that though, I think that the technology of Snapchat and PokémonGo are similar forms of a possible eave of new apps and games that can be created from them. They seem more socially acceptable than what VR could become. Perhaps I've seen too many Sci-Fi movies but it could go into being more addictive and antisocial than social media while the Snapchat and PokémonGo technologies seem to be VR lite to me. They have inspired two ideas in me.

1. An app that combines PokémonGo eith language learning apps. I speak very basic conversational Spanish and have learnt a large part of it through Duolingo but I have also seen people increase their vocabulary of a second language through post it notes. E.g. One would put a post it note on a clock with reloj (Spanish for clock). This could be done in a similar way to how PokemonGo works. Obviously this only addresses nouns so perhaps pop-ups could encourage you to use the noun with a range of verb, adjective and tense possibilities. The app could also put you in contact with other people who are learning like Tinder to help improve conversation but I dont knoe hiw this could monetise if it is done for free other than advertising.

2. An app that is used at historical sites especially ruins to give people an idea of what they looked like in the past through Snapchat type of filters. The tourist could also get a filter that could make them appear to be dressed in the attire of a person from the golden age of the ruin. E.g. Imagine getting photos or videos of the Acropolis in its golden age ehile you are dressed in the attire of the time. I believe some simple versions of this idea have been done before. I saw a Tasmanian colonial version of this on the news but I did arrive at this independently. One of the down sides of this is that many would find it tacky which it could be but with the improvement of technology I think that it could be done well and many would pay a small price for this app just as they do with audio guides.
